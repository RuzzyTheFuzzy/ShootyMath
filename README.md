So for the assignment i did the following.
Intersection using my own subsystem to work as a kind of piercing sniper rife. Left click to shoot those red cubes ^w^
Collision should be rather obvious with the cubes jumping
Context i used to make the platforms be one way. So if the cubes are below them, no collisions happen.
For interpelation and noice, i used it to create the spawn pattern. Sorry i did it in a blueprint, but i was getting very tired and didnt wanna bother with spawning stuff in code.

WASD to move, Space to jump i think might have forgotten to add it.
Left click to shoot them red cubies.

Hope this suffices cause AAAA.
